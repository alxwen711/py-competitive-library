frequency map/hash table file

given array, return frequency of each value in array/dict
with dict exact positions can be located
letter variations can be included here as well

func_a(x,y,z)
[explain func_a and its parameters]
func_b(x,y)
[explain func_b and its parameters]
Other useful things to note for documenting:
- Edge cases that the algorithm may not work for
- Runtime (O(1),O(log n),O(n),O(n^2),etc.)
