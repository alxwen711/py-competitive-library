# py-competitive-library
Repository containing useful templates for data structures and algorithms written in Python. Python as a competitive programming language is viable.


# Contributing
This is a relatively new project I've began so all contributions are greatly appreciated. For any documentation edits (in Python files or README) simply create a pull request and I'll review it as soon as I can. 

If you want to add a new Python algorithm/data structure then use the format given in newTemplate.py. The goal is to create the algorithm in Python so that it is:

- Easy to understand
- Can be easily modified to fit specific problems
- Practical for use in competition

I will typically review pull requests around 2-4 UTC daily. This is mainly because I do not want to be merging while a CodeForces/CodeChef contest is occuring, and they do not occur at this time. 

If I have not responded to a PR after two weeks without reason then and ONLYthen you can follow [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12686545/how-to-leave-a-message-for-a-github-com-user) to privately message me. For obvious reasons, please do not abuse the above.
